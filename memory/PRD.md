## Iter 216h11 — Spec Sheet dropdown crash + bulk delete + image graceful degradation (Feb 11, 2026)

**Production bugs reported**: (a) Master Admin → Image Catalogue → Spec Sheets dropdown was crashing the entire page (React error "Objects are not valid as a React child"). (b) Spec Sheet hero images were rendering as blank/broken-image icons. (c) User requested a "bulk select + delete" workflow.

### What shipped
- **`AdminSpecSheets.js` — `safeRenderValue()` helper**: Recursively coerces any JSON value (including nested objects like `{value, unit}`, `{min, max}`, generic `{key:value}`) into a compact human-readable string. Wraps every `key_specs` cell + `description` so the AI extractor can never crash the route again.
- **`AdminSpecSheets.js` — `<SpecImage>` component**: Adds `onError → "No image" placeholder` fallback for the public `/api/spec-sheets/image/{id}` endpoint. When the underlying S3/storage object is missing the user sees a friendly placeholder instead of a broken-image icon.
- **`AdminSpecSheets.js` — `<ExpandedDetail>` component**: Extracted to its own component with a defensive try/catch render guard (`spec-expand-error-{id}` test-id) so any future malformed payload can't take down the whole panel.
- **Bulk select + delete**:
  - Per-row checkbox (`spec-select-{id}`).
  - "Select all (N)" / "Clear selection" toggle (`spec-select-all`).
  - Sticky black bulk-action bar at top with row count + red "Delete N selected" button (`spec-bulk-bar`, `spec-bulk-delete`).
  - Loops `DELETE /api/spec-sheets/{id}` per selected id, shows mixed-success toast (`X deleted · Y failed`) and refreshes the grid.
- **PDF preview fallback**: iframe `onError` switches to a small "PDF preview unavailable" card so a missing storage object doesn't leave an empty panel.

### Verified live (preview)
- Seeded 2 test spec sheets (one with object-shaped `key_specs` — the exact crash vector) — page renders all of `flywheel weight: 22 kg`, `resistance: 1–24`, `dimensions: length: 120cm; width: 55cm; height: 115cm` plus the object-shaped description `short: …; long: …` without crashing.
- "Select all (2)" → black bulk bar visible → "Delete 2 selected" red button rendered → "Clear selection" dismisses bar.
- Missing `hero_image_url` shows placeholder icon (no broken-image).
- 0 captured `pageerror`s during the flow.

### Regression — `test_iter_216h11_spec_sheet_render_safety.py` (4/4 passing)
1. `test_list_returns_raw_object_key_specs` — backend round-trips object-shaped values unchanged (bug surface stays observable).
2. `test_delete_spec_sheet_hard_deletes_row` — single DELETE wipes a seeded row (powers bulk loop).
3. `test_delete_missing_spec_sheet_returns_404` — graceful 404 on already-deleted ids.
4. `test_image_endpoint_is_public_and_404s_cleanly` — endpoint returns 404 (not 401) when no image is stored so `<SpecImage>` placeholder triggers correctly.

### ⚠ Action required
Lives in **preview** only — **redeploy** to push to gymaxisai.com. If the production images stay blank after deploying, the underlying S3/storage objects are missing — re-upload affected spec sheets.

## Iter 216h10 — Fix for "0 records wiped" on production purge (Feb 10, 2026)

**Production bug reported**: user clicked "Remove everywhere" on Craig Henshall, toast showed "0 record(s) wiped" but the row remained. Root cause: my iter-216h8 purge endpoint only deleted from `db.users`, but the "Already added" check in `master_admin.py::add_user_to_organization` also looks at `db.crm_users` — so a stale row in `crm_users` was blocking re-onboarding without being touched by the purge.

### What shipped
- **Backend**: extended both `hard_purge_pulse_admin` (by id) AND `hard_purge_user_by_email` to ALSO delete from `db.crm_users`. Audit-log queries extended to find crm_users matches too, with `_collection: "crm_users"` annotation so the audit trail makes it obvious where rows came from.
- **Frontend `GlobalUsersPanel.js`**: fixed misleading toast — when the email regex matches 0 rows, the toast now shows a **warning** (not success) with actionable hint, AND automatically falls back to a hard-delete by user_id (auto-archives first since hard-delete is archive-gated). Fallback emits its own success toast indicating it was used. Success toast also now mentions CRM rows wiped when applicable.

### Why the fallback path matters
If the stored email has a hidden character, weird whitespace, or unexpected format, the email-regex match returns 0 — but we still have the user_id from the row that was clicked. Falling back to id-based delete catches this edge case without operator intervention.

### Regression — `test_iter_216h8_user_purge.py` extended to 5 tests (was 4)
- New `test_purge_by_email_also_wipes_crm_users` seeds a crm_users row and verifies the purge endpoint deletes it. **All 5 pass.**

## Iter 216h9 — Global Users panel + leaver workflow (Feb 10, 2026)
(See CHANGELOG history — fully shipped, 109 users panel with archive/delete + remove-everywhere, 4-pill status filter, master-admin auto-protected.)

## Prioritised backlog (P0/P1/P2)

### P0 — Currently in-progress
- None — iter 216h11 just landed.

### P1 — Reported bugs (next)
- **Carshalton invoice import**: missing details + supplier matching. **BLOCKED** awaiting user to upload an example PDF/image so the LLM extraction prompt can be tuned.
- **Head Office site not selectable for owners**: site-selector should show "All sites | Head Office | Site A | Site B" for multi-site orgs.
- **RAM usage metric on Trust & Reliability dashboard**: build via `psutil` per-pod gauge backend → existing T&R UI tile. Helps user decide on package upgrade.
- **"Jump to this user" link** in error toast when an existing user is re-added on the org drawer.

### P1 — Integration work
- Sage 200 / Sicon ledger posting on payment, CRM lead conversion, custom domains (`join.{gym-domain}.com`).

### P2 — Blocked / Parked
- Sicon and Sage 200 LIVE connection cutover (waiting on creds).
- Sentry DSN for production observability (Parked).
- Twilio SMS real integration (Parked).

## Critical operator notes
- User tests on **production** (gymaxisai.com). Agent only sees **preview**. Remind them to hit "Deploy" after each fix lands.
- Recent deploy failure was a "pod not found" infra error — fix is to re-hit Deploy (NOT a code issue).
- Master Admin credentials: `admin@gymaxisai.com` / `MasterAdmin123!` (always preserved).
- Preview DB has been wiped — only the master admin + Tottenham Green Leisure Centre data remain (since iter 215bs).
