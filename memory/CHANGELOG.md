## Jun 8, 2026 — Pulse Master Admin People tab: matrix access + tab cleanup

Three issues reported by the Pulse Master Admin (production screenshot, People → Roles):

- **"Couldn't load matrix — Master admin access required":** the SOC-2 Permissions matrix reads `GET /master-admin/pulse-admins`, which was `_require_gymaxis_master`-gated. Widened that **read-only list** to `_require_pulse_or_master` (now also accepts `is_pulse_admin`) in `routes/pulse_master_admin.py`; provisioning (create/revoke/purge) stays GymAxis-master-only. Pulse admin now sees the matrix (Active Admins, rows, tiles). Verified by curl (was 403 → now `{admins:[…]}`) + `tests/test_iter222_pulse_admin_list_access.py` 4/4.
- **Removed "Pulse Master Admins" tab** for Pulse admins — provisioning is now consolidated into Organisations + the Directory.
- **Removed "Legacy users panel" tab** for Pulse admins — everything lives in the Directory.
- Both tabs are hidden via `isPulseAdmin` filtering in `AdminRoles.js` (passed from `MasterAdminPage.js`); the `onOpenLegacyEdit` drawer action is also suppressed for Pulse admins so it can't target a hidden tab. The full GymAxis platform Master Admin still sees all five tabs. Verified live — Pulse admin tabs are now: Directory · Permissions matrix · Service Desk team.



## Jun 8, 2026 — Pulse Master Admin overview scoping + UI/rendering fixes (P0 batch)

Follow-up to the prior Pulse-admin scoping work. Confirmed plan = P0 + restyle two dark panels. Done & verified live (logged in as `pulse.admin.test@pulsefitness.com`):

- **Hide GymAxis Trials + email data (P0-1):** `AdminOverview.js` now hides the cross-module `UnifiedTrialsCard` for `isPulseAdmin`; `SidebarConfig.js` marks `trials` + `emails` (and `pending-review`) `gymaxisOnly: true` so the Growth/Overview sub-tab bars drop them; `MasterAdminPage.js` hides the top-bar `EmailHealthPill` for Pulse admins and the Overview subtitle no longer says "trials".
- **Overview KPI cards interactive (P0-2):** Organisations→`organizations`, Active Users→`roles`, Monthly Revenue→`payments` are now clickable (role=button, keyboard-accessible, hover lift). Open Cases stays a tooltip stat (no master-admin faults list to route to).
- **Remove "Pending review" (P0-3):** `pending-review` sub-tab `gymaxisOnly` → gone from the Pulse Overview sub-tabs.
- **Integration Health for Pulse admins (P0-4):** root cause was the backend gate. `routes/integration_health.py` `_require_master_admin` → new `_require_health_access` (master **or** pulse admin) on both `/master-admin/integration-health[/{key}]`. Verified: Pulse admin now gets the 5-check summary (was 403). Pytest `tests/test_iter222_integration_health_access.py` 4/4.
- **Documents "black card" restyled (light):** the dark `Pulse Fitness — meeting handouts` banner + pager cards in `DocumentsPanel.js` now match the light console theme.
- **Custom Domains page restyled (light):** `CustomDomainsPanel.js` converted from the legacy dark zinc palette to white cards / slate borders / dark text, consistent with the rest of Settings & Compliance.

Lint clean; screenshot-verified each surface.

**P1 — Theme Settings brand isolation (done same day):** `ThemeSettingsPanel.js` now hides the GymAxis namespace token card (`ns.id === 'gymaxis'`), the GymAxis brand preset, and rewrites the header card copy for `isPulseAdmin`; `MasterAdminPage.js` makes the `theme-settings` page subtitle Pulse-neutral ("Your Pulse Fitness design tokens and per-tenant brand overrides."). Verified live — Pulse admin sees only Pulse tokens/preset, no "GymAxis (marketing/admin)" wording.



## Jun 8, 2026 — Pulse Master Admin scoping: hide GymAxis internals, brand-scope social library

Follow-up to the login-redirect/Master-Admin-button fix. Six Pulse-admin issues reported on the live site:

- **Access denied (System Health, Ask Support Desk, Analytics):** these endpoints are `is_master_admin`-only (cross-tenant GymAxis platform internals). Marked them — plus Partner Engineers, Client crashes, Support tools, Database viewer, Maintenance jobs — `gymaxisOnly: true` in `SidebarConfig.js`, so they're hidden from delegated Pulse admins (existing sidebar + sub-tab-bar machinery already filters `gymaxisOnly`). No more permission-denied toasts.
- **"Scope locked" / "Pulse Admin" badges removed:** `BrandPicker.js` now shows a plain "Pulse Fitness" pill (no "Scope locked", no tooltip); removed the amber "Pulse Admin" pill from `MasterAdminPage.js`.
- **Social media library GymAxis crossover + delete-not-persisting (root cause):** `social_media_library.py` re-seeded a campaign whenever its count hit zero, so deletes reappeared; and the collection was global (Pulse admin saw GymAxis-branded posts). Fix: (a) every row now carries a `brand` ('gymaxis'|'pulse'); legacy rows back-filled to 'gymaxis'; (b) seeding runs **once** via a `platform_config` marker (`social_library_seed`) instead of on-empty; (c) `list/add/delete` are brand-scoped to the caller. Pulse admins now see a clean Pulse-only library (0 GymAxis posts), deletes persist, and cross-brand deletes 404. Verified by curl (pulse=0/gymaxis=24; delete persists at 23; cross-brand delete=404) + `tests/test_iter222_social_library_scope.py`.
- **Brand-neutral share text** in `SocialMediaLibraryPanel.js`.

DEFERRED → resolved (option a): the Social/SEO **Autopilot content engine** (`utils/social_autopilot.py`) is deeply GymAxis-branded. Per user choice, **Social Autopilot, SEO Autopilot, and the GymAxis Growth Hub are now hidden from Pulse admins** (`gymaxisOnly: true` in `SidebarConfig.js`). A proper Pulse-Fitness-branded autopilot remains a future build.

Preview-only — REDEPLOY to gymaxisai.com to go live.


## Jun 8, 2026 — Pulse Master Admin: login redirect + Master Admin console button fix

- **Login redirect (P0):** Pulse Master Admins (`is_pulse_admin=true`, `is_master_admin=false`)
  now land on `/pulse` (their modules) at login instead of the Master Admin console.
  Logic in `Navbar.js` `loginToPortal` (full GymAxis platform admins still → `/master-admin`).
- **BUG FIX:** Clicking the **Master Admin** button (user menu) as a Pulse Master Admin
  bounced straight back to the operations module. Root cause: the inline render guard
  `if (showMasterAdmin && user?.is_master_admin)` in `LiteDashboardPage.js` (line ~685)
  and `DashboardPage.js` (line ~184) excluded Pulse admins (who have `is_master_admin=false`).
  Both guards now read `(user?.is_master_admin || user?.is_pulse_admin)`. `MasterAdminPage`
  was already Pulse-aware (scoped console), so it renders correctly for them.
- Verified: frontend compiles clean; backend `/auth/login` + `/auth/me` return
  `is_pulse_admin:true`. UI e2e blocked by preview `/api` 403 gate — validate on live
  site after redeploy.


## Jun 8, 2026 — Assign existing staff as Pulse Master Admin (role-based)

**Problem (production):** the dedicated "Provision Pulse Platform Admin" form only creates NEW users — assigning an EXISTING staff member (already an org owner) 409'd ("user already exists"). User wanted role-based assignment in one place (Master Admin / Owner / Manager / Staff).

**Solution — "Master Admin" is now a brand-aware assignable role in the normal user-management role dropdown:**
- Assigning **Master Admin** to a user in a **Pulse org** (account_type `pulse_pro/pulse_lite/pulse` or brand `pulse*`) provisions a **Pulse Master Admin** (`role="pulse_master_admin"`, `is_pulse_admin=True`, NOT full platform `is_master_admin`). Same Master Admin dashboard + org impersonation, scoped to Pulse data. Assigning it in a GymAxis org keeps full-admin behaviour.
- **Promotes existing staff in place** (keeps their password). Stores `pulse_admin_previous_role`. Demoting back to Owner/Manager/Staff strips the elevated flags; sessions are revoked on any role change.
- Backend: `_org_is_pulse()` + brand-aware logic in `add_user_to_organization` and `admin_edit_user` (`routes/master_admin_users.py`); `list_pulse_admins` now merges `crm_users` so promoted CRM-portal staff appear in the Pulse Admins panel (`routes/pulse_master_admin.py`).
- Frontend: brand-aware "Master Admin (Pulse)" / "Master Admin (full platform)" labels + a `pulse_master_admin` display option across the inline org-user select, Add-user and Edit-user dialogs (`AdminOrganizations.js`); Navbar now routes/show the Dashboard→Master Admin button for `is_pulse_admin` users too (`Navbar.js`).
- Impersonation already works for Pulse admins (`require_master_admin` allows `is_pulse_admin`, scoped by `assert_user_in_pulse_scope`).

Verified via curl (promote→`pulse_master_admin` + previous_role saved; demote→flags cleared/restored; promoted user appears in Pulse Admins panel) and UI (dropdown shows brand-aware label). Tests: `tests/test_iter222_pulse_master_admin_role.py` (3) pass. **Preview-only — REDEPLOY for production.**


## Jun 8, 2026 — Fix: Social Autopilot screenshot ↔ copy mismatch

**Bug (reported from production):** a feature post showed the CRM-pipeline screenshot but the headline/caption advertised a "Smart Rota Builder" (scheduling). Root cause: the launch/feature prompt passed the feature name only as a soft "hint", so Claude invented unrelated products (topic `crm_pipeline` → headline "Smart Staff Scheduling"). The screenshot is keyed to the topic's `feature_id`, so the feature-keyed image no longer matched the drifted copy.

**Fix (two layers):**
1. **Hard feature binding** in `build_launch_prompt` + `build_prompt` (feature path): an explicit "FEATURE YOU ARE WRITING ABOUT — do not change it" block (exact name + hook) with a rule to never invent/rename/substitute a different product (e.g. no "Rota Builder", "Smart Scheduling", "Ops Dashboard"). Keeps the **caption** on-feature.
2. **Deterministic guarantee for screenshot posts** in `generate_post_for_channel`: the on-image headline is forced to the canonical feature label (`feature_pillar_by_id(...).label`) so image and headline can never diverge; if no real screenshot resolves, it falls back to a feature card instead of showing a mismatched image.

Verified: regenerated fresh drafts — every screenshot post's headline + caption now match its feature (CRM→CRM, Sage/Sicon→finance, Supplier/CAPEX→tender pipeline). 52 social tests pass. **Preview-only — REDEPLOY for production (gymaxisai.com).**


## Jun 8, 2026 — Social Autopilot: AI Poster Assistant (prompt → on-brand poster)

Added an in-panel **AI Poster Assistant** (Master Admin → Growth → Social Autopilot) — the operator types a prompt and gets an on-brand poster saved as a draft. Per operator's choices: **on-brand templates only** (no freeform/generative images), simple **prompt→poster form**, output **saved straight into the draft queue** with AI-written caption + hashtags, and **no screenshots** in this flow.

- Backend: `compose_post_from_prompt()` + `build_compose_prompt()` in `utils/social_autopilot.py`; route `POST /api/marketing/social-autopilot/compose` (master-admin, 30/hr rate limit). Claude picks the best layout from hook/stat/feature/punchline and writes caption/hashtags/headline. **Numbers safety:** for stat layouts the model must reuse a figure from the operator's prompt OR copy a curated `PRODUCT_STATS`/`INDUSTRY_STATS` item verbatim — never invent one (empty/missing stat falls back to a curated product fact). Renders via the deterministic template engine (`image_model="prompt:<layout>"`).
- Frontend: `PosterAssistant` component in `SocialAutopilotPanel.js` — prompt textarea + idea chips + optional headline + channel select + layout select (Auto/Hook/Stat/Feature/Punchline) + Generate. On success the new draft appears in the queue. testids: `poster-assistant`, `poster-prompt-input`, `poster-headline-input`, `poster-channel-select`, `poster-layout-select`, `poster-generate-btn`, `poster-idea-chip`.
- Verified end-to-end in the live UI (prompt → auto-picked stat card → saved to Instagram drafts) and via curl (stat + punchline). Tests: `tests/test_iter222_poster_assistant.py` (8) pass; 17 Iter-222 social tests green total. **Preview-only — REDEPLOY for production.**

## Jun 7, 2026 — Split sales decks + real app screenshots

- Finalised two audience-split sales presentations with "GymAxisAI" branding + white-pill logo:
  - `GymAxisAI-Operators-Presentation.pdf` (14pp) and `GymAxisAI-Suppliers-Presentation.pdf` (12pp), served from `/app/frontend/public/downloads/` and linked in the public marketing footer (`MarketingShell.js`, testids `gx-footer-sales-deck-operators` / `-suppliers`). Old combined deck deleted.
- Replaced wireframe mockups with **real, populated, Pulse-free screenshots** captured from a new neutral demo tenant **"Apex Fitness Group"** (`apex-demo-org`, account_type `full` → GymAxis branding):
  - Operators deck: CRM sales pipeline, Operations equipment register, Memberships analytics.
  - Suppliers deck: engineer job dashboard (Service Desk slide), asset fault/service log.
  - Marketing slide (operators) + Van-stock & Engineer-phone slides (suppliers) kept their wireframes — no convincing demo data without disproportionate seeding.

### Follow-up (same day) — last 2 wireframe slides now real + marketing routing bugfix
- Seeded Apex **Marketing** (4 audiences + 5 email campaigns w/ metrics, A/B) and engineer **Van stock** (9 parts, low/out badges, £4,112 value) via `backend/seed_apex_marketing_vanstock.py`.
- **Bug fixed (platform-wide):** `routes/marketing_downloads.py` had a greedy `GET /marketing/{slug}` catch-all that shadowed `GET /api/marketing/campaigns|audiences|templates`, 404-ing the Marketing **Campaigns/Audiences/Templates** tabs for *all* orgs (incl. master admin). Replaced with explicit per-slug routes (public PDF URLs unchanged: `mod-briefing.pdf`, `mod.pdf`, `sicon-access.pdf`). Regression test: `tests/test_marketing_downloads_no_shadow.py` (2/2).
- Operators deck Marketing slide + Suppliers deck Van-stock slide now use real screenshots. **All 7 mock slides across both decks are now real app screenshots.** Only the Engineer-phone illustration (dark mobile mockup) remains a designed graphic by intent.
- New artifacts: `backend/seed_apex_demo.py`, `backend/seed_apex_crm.py` (idempotent), `sales/capture_*.py`, `sales/embed_shots.py`, `sales/render_pdf.py` (now renders both decks). Demo login + re-seed steps recorded in `test_credentials.md`.


## Jun 8, 2026 — Social Autopilot: killed hallucinated AI imagery, added a brand-accurate template engine

**Problem (operator report):** the autopilot produced off-brand images — fake "GYMAXIS.CO.UK" logo posters, hallucinated dashboards of "a system that isn't ours", and blank purple gradients. Root cause: the image pipeline alternated a reliable branded card (Variant B) with **raw Gemini image generation (Variant A)**, which invents garbled UIs/logos/text and sometimes returns a bare gradient.

**Fix — removed generative-AI imagery entirely. Every card is now rendered deterministically** (`backend/utils/social_templates.py`) from real brand tokens + the real GymAxis logo + correct `gymaxisai.com` domain, with 5 channel-aware layouts:
- `hook` — bold statement on brand gradient.
- `stat` — big number + label (numbers-led) on dark brand canvas. Figures come from **curated, never-fabricated** lists in `social_autopilot.py`: `PRODUCT_STATS` (literally true of GymAxis) and `INDUSTRY_STATS` (tagged "INDUSTRY ESTIMATE" on-card, never implied as customer results).
- `feature` — feature title + 3 LLM benefit bullets (no invented metrics).
- `punchline` — setup→payoff humour; auto-downgraded to a `stat` card on LinkedIn (drier).
- `screenshot` — a **REAL product screenshot** (curated into `backend/static/social/screenshots/`, reused from the sales-deck pipeline) composited into a browser frame. Fixes "screenshots of a system that isn't ours".

`pick_layout()` rotates layouts per channel/topic deterministically (variety, zero hallucination). `build_prompt`/`build_launch_prompt` now take `layout`+`stat` and inject layout-specific JSON keys + humour/numbers guidance. Orchestrator (`generate_post_for_channel`) renders via `render_social_card` (`image_model="template:<layout>"`); legacy branded card is the only fallback. `render_nano_banana_image` is now dead code (left in place, uncalled).

New endpoint `DELETE /api/marketing/social-autopilot/posts[?channel=]` (master-admin) clears drafts to "start over". Used to wipe 20 old drafts; regenerated fresh — all new posts confirmed `template:*` PNGs, verified in the live Master Admin → Growth → Social Autopilot UI.

Tests: `tests/test_iter222_social_templates.py` (10) + 51 existing social tests pass. Reference sites (`help.later.com`, `templates.memes.com`) didn't return scrapeable content, but the formats they champion (hooks, numbers-led, feature carousels, humour) are baked into the layout system. **Preview-only — REDEPLOY to push to gymaxisai.com.**

**Follow-up (same day) — stats + screenshot coverage tuned:**
- Refined `PRODUCT_STATS` (e.g. "6-in-1 — CRM, service desk, PPM, memberships, finance & marketing") and `INDUSTRY_STATS` (added "1 bad visit is all it takes for a member to start cancelling"; 4 items now), all still curated/never-fabricated.
- Widened `SCREENSHOT_MAP` to 11 features, each pointed at a DISTINCT, genuinely-matching real screen (ai_triage→faults, ppm_scheduler→schedule, membership_intelligence→mbr_analytics/churn, supplier_qa→suppliers, supplier_capex→tender pipeline). `communications_inbox` & `gdpr_workflow` left intentionally unmapped (no true screen → use feature card, never a misleading screenshot). New screens copied into `backend/static/social/screenshots/`. 61 social tests pass; all mappings verified to resolve to real files.



## Jun 8, 2026 — Phase 2: Manufacturer manual auto-link + per-type custom check sheets

Two P0 production feature requests delivered (both backend + frontend, tested).

**Task 1 — Equipment "Manufacturer manual" auto-link (read-only, all roles).**
- `EquipmentDetailContent` (`frontend/src/pages/LiteDashboard/LiteDialogs.js`, Documents section ~line 349): when an equipment item has a matched Master-Admin spec sheet (`spec_sheet_id`), the Documents list now surfaces it as a **"Manufacturer manual"** card with a blue **Read-only** badge, a View action (testid `equip-manual-view`, switches to the Spec Sheet tab) and a Download link (testid `equip-manual-download` → public `GET /api/spec-sheets/pdf/{id}`). Card testid `equip-manufacturer-manual`. Visible/downloadable by ALL roles; only Master Admin uploads spec sheets. Matching logic unchanged (auto-match on equipment create/import). Verified visually on Apex demo (temp-attached spec sheet, then reverted).

**Task 2 — Custom check sheets assignable to an equipment type (replaces default).**
- Backend (`backend/routes/check_sheets.py`): `POST /api/maintenance/templates` and `/check-sheets/custom-template` now persist `equipment_type` (stripped; empty string = general). GET endpoints return it. Pytest 4/4 (`tests/test_iter_phase2_check_template_equipment_type.py`).
- Frontend (`frontend/src/pages/CheckSheetsTab.js`): create dialog has an **"Applies to equipment type"** dropdown (testid `template-equipment-type-select`, options = org equipment types + "Any — general template"). `handleStartSheet` loads the assigned custom template's items **instead of** the built-in default for that type. Group cards show a blue assigned badge (`custom-assigned-<type>`); custom-template cards show their type badge (`custom-template-type-<idx>`).

Preview-only — user must REDEPLOY to gymaxisai.com for production.
